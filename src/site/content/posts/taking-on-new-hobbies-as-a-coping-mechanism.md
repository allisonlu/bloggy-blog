# swing dancing, june 2019 - present

my answer to the question "Why did you start to learn swing dance?":

> My swing dance journey only started recently. My coworker, who is a seasoned swing dancer of four years, invited me to my first social dance. I was filled with anxious dread, but also curious excitement as I had no prior experience with dancing. With only a quick basic lesson, I jumped onto the dance floor. People asked me for dances with approachable smiles. I triple-stepped and I stumbled, I spun and I wobbled. Despite the pleasant challenge, I felt so welcomed and full of joy.
>
> I wanted more, so my coworker danced with me on our lunch breaks - anywhere and everywhere. They insisted I start lessons at Rustyâ€™s, where I learned basics in technical detail, created partner connection, and gained confidence in myself. 
>
> The atmosphere where swing dancers congregate was invigorating, so I wanted to immerse myself further. Some of my queer friends invited me to a LGBTQ+ friendly Lindy Hop switching practica, where leading and following were not associated with any gender. This was transformative and comforting to me - that such a niche existed, that freedom of expression can transcend any binary, that I felt so visible and supported.
>
> Those exact friends are performing in the Switch competition this year at Camp Hollywood. I want to show them the support that they have shown me. I want to improve my dance technique in general and also to learn to be as comfortable with leading as I am with following, so the classes would be very valuable to me. Not to mention learning on the social dance floor! One cannot become fluent in conversation without immersing themselves in the culture.
